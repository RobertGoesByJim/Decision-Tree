### As you begin a project, or as you begin to design a product or service:

Have you done a lot of the research up-front, or are you doing much of it early in your timeline, to find out most, if not all of the requirements your product or service needs to satisfy? And knowing what your thing needs to do, you likely also know *how* it’s going to do most of the things it needs to do?

-   Examples:
    -   With some known set of needs to satisfy, you know you need mapping software,. After a research phase, you decide on Google Maps to satisfy those needs - you know what it does, how it does it, how to interface, what you want it to do, and how to make it do that – the “implementation algorithm” is pretty straightforward. You know facts, the software has a known set of capabilities, and there’s really no trick to making it go.

    -   You need to prepare a server farm to run a large application in-house. You may need to schedule a number of procurement activities well in-advance of “Go-Live.”

IF the requirements are known, or you intend to uncover nearly all of them early in the process; or

IF the steps to completion (the “algorithm for implementation”) are largely known, predictable, and “estimate-able,” and/or

IF you need to construct or deploy something physical,

THEN consider a waterfall (or “Mode 1,”) approach

> - OR -

Is the thing you want to build “still kind of fuzzy,” is the concept or technology quite innovative?

Is the algorithm for implementation unknown? Will you need to :

-   Test some theories?

-   Clarify the vision, or objectives, through experimentation?

    Are you comfortable presenting quick implementations of concepts to stakeholders so that they can solidify their vision, then making quick course-corrections based on their feedback?

Is the primary thing you’re building software, and/or innovative, leading-edge, a “half-baked idea?” (*By the way, leading-edge and innovative software, products, and services, are often unknown, and by nature even “half-baked” - and that’s ok. Some of the possibilities and details will need to be discovered.*)

Does what you’re building require significant discovery, or learning “spikes?”

-   To uncover the possibilities, to find out how something works?

-   To clarify the requirements - what the thing needs to do, and even for whom?

IF some or all of these apply,

THEN consider a Mode 2, or agile, approach, and

ensure that:

-   The feature-set of the product or service to be implemented is broken down into very small discrete chunks or features that can be tackled more or less independently, each one time-boxed and presented to the customer for feedback when “done” (this accurately suggests that any given “chunk” can be “done” more than once.)

-   The customer, and a number of target users of the product/service, can be dedicated to its design, and can be available to participate actively for the duration of the effort.
